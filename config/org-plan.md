# Organization Chart Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Model and Entities
- [x] Department Entity
  - Base fields (id, name, description)

  - Soft delete and timestamp fields
  - Validation rules

- [x] Position Entity
  - Base fields (id, title, description, level)
  - Relations (department, parent position, employees)
  - Soft delete and timestamp fields
  - Validation rules

- [x] Employee Entity
  - Base fields (id, firstName, lastName, email, etc.)
  - Relations (position, department, manager)
  - Soft delete and timestamp fields
  - Validation rules

## 2. Database Migrations
- [x] Department table migration
- [x] Position table migration
- [x] Employee table migration
- [x] Relation tables migrations
- [x] Index creation

## 3. Repository Layer
- [x] BaseRepository implementation
- [x] DepartmentRepository
  - Custom queries (tree structure, sub-departments)

  - Custom queries (hierarchy, department-based)
- [x] EmployeeRepository
  - Custom queries (manager-based, department-based)

## 4. Service Layer
- [x] DepartmentService
  - CRUD operations
  - Tree structure operations
  - Validation rules
  - Business rules (manager assignment, hierarchy checks)

- [x] PositionService
  - CRUD operations
  - Hierarchy operations
  - Validation rules
  - Business rules (department compatibility)

- [x] EmployeeService
  - CRUD operations
  - Manager-employee relations
  - Validation rules
  - Business rules (position changes)

- [x] OrgChartService
  - Organization chart generation
  - Department-based view
  - Employee-based view
  - Hierarchy calculations

## 5. Controller Layer
- [x] DepartmentController
  - Endpoint implementations
  - Request/Response DTOs
  - Validation

- [x] EmployeeController
  - Endpoint implementations
  - Request/Response DTOs
  - Validation
  - Swagger documentation

- [x] OrgChartController
  - Endpoint implementations
  - Request/Response DTOs
  - Swagger documentation

## 6. DTOs and Type Definitions
- [x] Department DTOs (Create, Update, Response)
- [x] Position DTOs (Create, Update, Response)
- [x] Employee DTOs (Create, Update, Response)
- [x] OrgChart DTOs (Tree, Node, Response)
- [x] Enum definitions
- [x] Custom type definitions

## 7. Validation and Business Rules
- [x] Custom validation decorators
- [x] Business rule validators
- [x] Hierarchy check mechanisms
- [x] Error messages and codes

## 8. Test Layer
- [x] Unit tests
  - Service tests
  - Validation tests
  - Business rule tests

- [x] Integration tests
  - API endpoint tests
  - Database operation tests
  - Hierarchy operation tests

## 9. Documentation
- [x] API documentation (Swagger)
- [x] Database schema documentation
- [x] Business rules documentation
- [x] Installation and usage guide

## 10. Performance and Optimization
- [x] Database indexes
- [x] Query optimizations
- [x] N+1 query optimizations

## 11. Security and Access Control
- [ ] Authentication system
  - JWT based authentication
  - Token management
  - Session handling
- [ ] Authorization system
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Permission management
  - Resource-level access control
- [ ] API security
  - Rate limiting
  - Request validation
  - CORS configuration

## 12. Caching Strategy
- [ ] Redis integration
- [ ] Cache configuration
  - Cache keys design
  - TTL settings
  - Cache invalidation rules
- [ ] Implement caching for
  - Department tree
  - Organization chart
  - Frequently accessed data

## 13. Bulk Operations
- [ ] Bulk create endpoints
  - Multiple departments
  - Multiple positions
  - Multiple employees
- [ ] Bulk update endpoints
  - Position changes
  - Department transfers
  - Manager assignments
- [ ] Bulk delete endpoints
  - With validation rules
  - With hierarchy checks

## 14. Advanced Reporting
- [ ] Department reports
  - Employee count
  - Position distribution
  - Hierarchy depth
- [ ] Position reports
  - Level distribution
  - Vacancy analysis
  - Reporting lines
- [ ] Employee reports
  - Department distribution
  - Management chain
  - Position history

## Progress Order
1. Security and Access Control
2. Caching Strategy
3. Bulk Operations
4. Advanced Reporting

## Notes
- Code review at each step
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- All endpoints must be documented
- Performance metrics must be tracked

## Priority Business Rules
1. A department can have only one manager
2. An employee can have only one position
3. Circular hierarchy is not allowed
4. Special rules for sub-departments and employees when deleting a department
5. Authority checks for position changes
